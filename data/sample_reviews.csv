1,"The rudest, unsmiling lady I ever encountered in my life! We came in, lady took forever to even acknowledge our presence & when she half-heartedly and with a scowl on her face finally did, she made us feel like we were a bother to her. What kind of a place is this? We came to order their crispy calamaris because King Chicken Wing was out of them and since we drove 2 1/2 hours away, we didn't want to go home empty handed. We found this Chef P take out place on Google. Huge mistake! It would have been fine if Chef P's calamaris were comparable to King Chicken Wing....but they're not even close to KCW's light, crispy, delicious calamaris. What topped off the disappointment with Chef P's calamaris is the bad attitude of the lady. We will never go back!",
4,"I am a fan of the food here. It's quick casual where you can walk up to the counter and order off the menu. I usually get the Basic Betty with Swiss and mushrooms. Tonight we tried the 50/50 which was crispy shoe string fries and onion rings. The fries were fresh, but the onion rings were squishy. I think we might have received an old batch. Quick and friendly service.",
5,"This place was incredible in terms of both speed and taste. My party of five was seated immediately and the waiter brought out glasses of water and an extra pitcher for us right away. After ordering, we only had to wait less than 10 minutes for all of our food to come out!",
5,Always a good deal. Real food at real prices. We used to come here for Sunday sinners all the time in the late '60s and early '70s. The chili has changed but I don't blame them. I suggest the petite steak dinner for $8.99 or the mixed grill that is pork chop & chicken breast. The 1/2 lb. steerburger is another excellent choice.,
